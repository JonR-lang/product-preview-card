## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

I didn't learn anything new  I guess. Oh, I learnt a little bit on how to use max-width and min-width properties. However, at the moment, I just did "guess work". That is I alternate between the both of them until i get what I want. Does that make me a bad coder? :(
I also learnt how to apply the fonts from https://fonts.google.com, in an offline mode. That is, I get to use the fonts offline without being connected to the internet.


### Continued development

I had a little problem with making the page responsive, especially in mobile devices. This was because I wasn't well versed in the knowledge and applications of 
"max-width" and "min-width". I'm really looking out for friends and resources that would help me understand their applications, so as to become better in making responsive web-pages!

### Useful resources
